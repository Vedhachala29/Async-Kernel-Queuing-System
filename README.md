## Description:

Loadable Kernel Module to perform jobs asynchronously using kernelâ€™s work queues

Designed an in-kernel queueing system that performs various operations
asynchronously and more efficiently. I have used the inbuilt work queues APIs to perform the
below-stated operations asynchronously and also support various operations on the queue

### File operations supported:

    delete multiple files
    rename multiple files
    stat() multiple files
    concatenate 2 or more files onto a new one
    compute and return a hash for a file
    encrypt or decrypt a file


### Queue Operations supported:

    Submit a new job. 
    Job Status.
    Poll results of a job.
    Delete a pending job.
    Reorder a job.
    List all jobs.
